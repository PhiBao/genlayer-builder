## üëÄ About
This project demonstrates the power of GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts through a comprehensive AI-powered prediction markets platform. Unlike traditional prediction markets, this implementation leverages GenLayer's unique capabilities for web data access, AI-driven analysis, and non-deterministic operations to create truly intelligent markets.

## üöÄ Deployed Contract

- **Deployer:** `0x86E95581E41946ED84956433a8a9c836bCbA636c`
- **Studio:** https://studio.genlayer.com

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment details and usage instructions.

## ÔøΩüì¶ What's included
- **Advanced Prediction Market Contract** (`contracts/prediction_market.py`) - Multi-category markets with AI-powered resolution
- **Legacy Football Betting Contract** (`contracts/football_bets.py`) - Original simple betting example

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- A running GenLayer Studio (Install from [Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tooling-setup#using-the-genlayer-studio) or work with the hosted version of [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/)). If you are working locally, this repository code does not need to be located in the same directory as the Genlayer Studio.
- [GenLayer CLI](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-cli) globally installed. To install or update the GenLayer CLI run `npm install -g genlayer`

## üöÄ Steps to run this example

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security First
Before starting, secure your private keys:
- Copy `keypair.json.example` to `keypair.json` and add your private key
- Never commit `keypair.json` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for secure key management

### 1. Deploy the prediction market contract
   Deploy the enhanced prediction market contract from `/contracts/prediction_market.py`:
   1. Choose the network that you want to use (studionet, localnet, or tesnet-*): `genlayer network`
   2. Execute the deploy command `genlayer deploy`. This will deploy the PredictionMarket contract located in `/contracts/prediction_market.py`
   
   **Note**: The deploy script has been updated to use the new prediction market contract instead of the legacy football betting contract.

### 2. Setup the frontend environment
  1. All the content of the dApp is located in the `/app` folder.
  2. Copy the `.env.example` file in the `app` folder and rename it to `.env`, then fill in the values for your configuration. The provided VITE_STUDIO_URL value is the backend of the hosted GenLayer Studio.
  3. Add the deployed contract address to the `/app/.env` under the variable `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

### 4. Run the frontend Vue app
   Execute the following commands in your terminal:
   ```shell
   cd app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The terminal should display a link to access your frontend app (usually at http://localhost:5173/).
   For more information on the code see [GenLayerJS](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-js).

## ‚öΩ How the Football Bets Contract Works

The Football Bets contract allows users to create bets for football matches, resolve those bets, and earn points for correct bets. Here's a breakdown of its main functionalities:

1. Creating Bets:
   - Users can create a bet for a specific football match by providing the game date, team names, and their predicted winner.
   - The contract checks if the game has already finished and if the user has already made a bet for this match.

2. Resolving Bets:
   - After a match has concluded, users can resolve their bets.
   - The contract fetches the actual match result from a specified URL.
   - If the Bet was correct, the user earns a point.

3. Querying Data:
   - Users can retrieve all bets.
   - The contract also allows querying of points, either for all players or for a specific player.

4. Getting Points:
   - Points are awarded for correct bets.
   - Users can check their total points or the points of any player.

## üß™ Tests
